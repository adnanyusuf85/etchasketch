define problem
we want to have an etch a sketch game. 
So this is how a physical etch a sketch works:
1. Its a small tablet kind of toy, that looks like a small white board
2. The user is able to use a pen like instrument / stylus to draw on the board
3. If the user wants to erase the work, he slides a slider across the screen and the sketch is wiped out
4. The user can then rework
5. The slider is a button in digital versions
6. Usually a light grid is seen on the etch a sketch board

plan
make a grid using divs and javascript but without using html grid functionality
keep the grid a light gray color
make the sketching based on pressure, with each hold on the div resulting in a slight darkening of the div


pseudocode for laying out the divs based on number of grid points (divs)
